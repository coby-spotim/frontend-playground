# Frontend Playground

As a mainly backend developer for most of my career, I've barely ever tried doing anything remotely related to frontend work. In fact, I'm pretty horrible with design and understanding how even basic HTML fits together, and I never understood CSS or JavaScript.

Because of this, I decided to challenge myself to learn at least something about Frontend, so that I can start understanding what my Frontend friends are talking about.
